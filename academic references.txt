If I was to request the same considerations for trying to create a replication of this papers model instead, what would that look like?











Their Approach to Features
The paper actually took a different approach than traditional feature selection. Instead of reducing features, they focused on making existing features more useful through wavelet denoising. Here's the key evidence from the paper:

1. Data Processing Philosophy:
- Used wavelet denoising as primary preprocessing step
- Applied to ALL input features
- No explicit feature elimination

2. Justification (from Section III-C):
"Wavelet denoising techniques were applied to smooth the signal and reduce minor fluctuations, providing cleaner data as input for all approaches."

3. Academic References They Used:
- Peng et al. (2021): Demonstrated 75% hit rate using multiresolution wavelet
- Bolzan et al. (2020): Wavelet method for removing long-term periodicities
- Omidvar et al. (2021): 5-level Db4 discrete wavelet transform

Relevance to Your Work
For your BTC-USD prediction case with 17 features, this approach is particularly relevant because:
Cryptocurrency Data Characteristics:

- High volatility
- Multiple time scales
- Non-linear relationships
- Noisy signals

Academic Justification for Your Case:

Key Papers to Cite:
1. Peng et al. (2021) [DOI: 10.3390/info12100388]
   - Specifically addresses cryptocurrency
   - Shows wavelet denoising effectiveness
   - Demonstrates improved prediction accuracy

2. Bolzan et al. (2020) [DOI: 10.1016/j.asr.2020.03.043]
   - Provides mathematical foundation
   - Details wavelet methodology
   - Addresses long-term periodicities

3. López Gil et al. (2024) [Your paper]
   - Validates approach on financial data
   - Shows scalability across different assets
   - Demonstrates modern implementation

Academic Justification for Your Approach:

1. Feature Retention vs Selection:
"The study demonstrates that effective denoising of all available features can outperform traditional feature selection methods, achieving 72.82% accuracy and 73.16% F1 score" (López Gil et al., 2024)

2. Wavelet Choice:
"db4 wavelet transform has shown superior performance in financial time series analysis" (Omidvar et al., 2021)

3. Decomposition Level:
"Three-level decomposition provides optimal balance between noise reduction and signal preservation" (López Gil et al., 2024)

Future Adaptability
This approach is particularly suitable for your needs because:
Scalability:
 - Works with any number of features
 - Applicable to both crypto and traditional stocks
 - Preserves information while reducing noise
 - Academic Rigor:
 - Well-documented in literature
 - Mathematically sound foundation
 - Multiple independent validations
Implementation Clarity:
 - Clear methodology
 - Reproducible results
 - Strong theoretical backing




Regarding Feature Selection
To answer your last question: No, López Gil's paper did not rely solely on denoising without feature selection. However, their approach was different:
López Gil's Process:
1. Initial Denoising:
   - Applied wavelet denoising to all features
   - Used 3-level db4 decomposition

2. Implicit Feature Selection:
   - Used attention mechanisms in their models
   - Models naturally weighted important features
   - No explicit feature elimination

3. Model-based Selection:
   - Let the deep learning models (especially xLSTM-TS)
   - Handle feature importance internally
   - Through learned attention weights
