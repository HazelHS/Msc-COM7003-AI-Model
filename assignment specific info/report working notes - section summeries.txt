report will:
1. entire production cyle (x2 models)
2. models from case studies, reflective of major areas in the domain research
3. models are: rondom forest, xLSTM-TS (long short term memory) x? TS?
4. general practices, theory and maths of the models functioning.
5. recommendations for further research.
6. case studies evaluations on their models implementations (for time series forecasting)
7. why explore btc specifically? Use case, domain "familiarality". (why the features chosen to include in the datasets)
8. evaluations resulting in practical considerations and key areas essential for the models performance. 
9. conclusion, implications: more fancy financial instruments that require ever increasing compuational overhead = they dont know they are the money cows.
