Performance Metrics from Chen et al.:
- Single Random Forest: Baseline
- López Gil's method: +8% improvement
- Tang's method: +11% improvement
- Chen's method: +15% improvement

López Gil: 3-fold CV with combined RF/MI scores
Tang: Fixed threshold with RF importance
Chen: Adaptive weighting based on market volatility


Would you like me to:
Implement Chen's full methodology with adaptive weighting?
Add their market regime detection code?
Include their specific performance metrics for comparison?
The main tradeoff is complexity vs. performance. Chen's method is more complex to implement but offers better performance, especially in volatile markets. For cryptocurrency prediction, this could be particularly valuable given the market's inherent volatility.




"We use 5-fold time series cross-validation (López Gil used 3-fold)" and "We select features above mean score (Tang used a fixed threshold)" Thank you for providing this information it is extremely helpful.
