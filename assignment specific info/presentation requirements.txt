Dataset selection and justification

Data exploration and preprocessing

Model selection and training

Performance evaluation and optimization.

Deployment considerations.

--------
Identify potential issues encountered during the development process, such as:
 Handling missing or imbalanced data.
 Avoiding data leakage.
 Ensuring model interpretability and fairness.
--------
Discuss broader ethical considerations, such as bias, fairness, and societal impacts. (traders without more advanced analysis will be more easily exploited, e.g. robinhood app) 
--------
Explanation and Demonstration of Developed Machine Learning Code:

o Code Walkthrough: Provide an overview of the key components of your machine
learning code, highlighting how you implemented your project.

o Demonstration: show outputs or results generated by your code to reinforce the
discussion, ensuring clear explanations of their significance.


7 seperate academic sources. (methodologies, and industry practices)

20min max

no more than 20 slides

explain the dev cycle, end to end.

use case study as example through-out 

(Explain the benefits machine learning offers within the context of your chosen problem
and dataset. Discuss how machine learning enhances decision-making and provides actionable
insights in the business domain.)
