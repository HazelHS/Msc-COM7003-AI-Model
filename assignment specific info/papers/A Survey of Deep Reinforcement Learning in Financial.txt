Abstract. This paper surveys the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in
stock price prediction, highlighting its potential and limitations. We explore how
RL can be used to optimize trading strategies, manage investment risks, find
arbitrage opportunities, and predict trends. The review classifies research objects
and methods based on data frequency (high/non-high) and target (forecast/trading
strategy). We analyze various asset classes (stocks, forex, etc.) and models (RL,
neural networks, LSTMs) employed in previous works. Key findings suggest that
RL offers advantages over traditional models by adapting to complex market
dynamics, and that incorporating sentiment analysis can further enhance its
effectiveness. We identify promising avenues for future research, including
hybrid models, deeper sentiment integration, and improved risk management.
Overall, the paper concludes that RL holds significant promise for transforming
financial forecasting, leading to more accurate and adaptable decision-making
tools.
Keywords: Reinforcement learning, stock price prediction, financial forecasting,

Introduction

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning method that learns by having an agent
take actions in its environment and adjust its policy based on feedback. In stock price
prediction, reinforcement learning can be used to build an intelligent agent that can take
actions in a stock market environment (such as buying or selling a stock) and adjust its
strategy based on market feedback (such as changes in stock prices).
First, reinforcement learning can help us optimize trading strategies to maximize
returns. By training an intelligent agent, we can make it learn to take optimal actions
under different market conditions. This may include determining when to buy, sell or
hold stocks and how to allocate weights in the portfolio.
Next, reinforcement learning can help us better manage investment risks. By training
an intelligent agent, we can make it learn to act conservatively or aggressively under
different market conditions to reduce potential losses. This may include setting stop-

loss and take-profit points, as well as adjusting portfolio weightings based on market
fluctuations.
Third, reinforcement learning can help us find arbitrage opportunities between
futures contracts with different expiration dates. By training an intelligent agent, we
can make it learn to perform intertemporal arbitrage under different market conditions
to achieve stable returns.
Finally, reinforcement learning can help us predict stock market trends. By training
an intelligent agent, we can make it learn to analyze historical data and predict future
price movements. This may include using technical indicators, fundamental data, and
other relevant information to predict market trends.
In summary, the application of reinforcement learning in stock price prediction has
broad potential. However, due to the complexity and uncertainty of the stock market,
reinforcement learning models may require large amounts of data and computing
resources for training, and may need to be continuously adjusted and optimized to adapt
to the changing market environment.

Criteria

In this section, two independent and different criteria would be used to divide research
objects into different types: 1) Input Data: daily/monthly/hourly bars and high
frequency limit order book data. The bars data are used for the purpose of non high
frequency trading. 2) Objects: Forecast and trading strategies. For trading strategy, the
aim is to discover investment decisions. For forecast, the results are based on forecasts,
but also embed other information, such as the certainty of the forecast (how much
should we invest) that influence decisions.

The Classification

Based on the appeal classification standard, we give the classification in Table 1. The
meaning of each class is as follows:
2.2.1Non-high Frequency Data & Forecast.
This type is using non-high frequency data to predict market return or direction.
References [21-24] belong to this type. Based on daily historical data, reference [24]
developed algorithm to the classification and prediction of stock price patterns. Besides

the daily price data, other information also be used as input for the forecast. Reference
[21] use daily sentiment data to predict stocks price moves. Reference [22] use internet
users attention level to predict the stock price. Reference [23] extract data and trading
data from news to predict stock movements.
2.2.2Non-high Frequency Data & Trading Strategy.
This type is using non-high frequency data to discover trading strategies. References
[5-8][9-18] belong to this type. With daily data as input, reference [6][9-13] developed
models for single stock trading. Reference [14] develop strategies for futures trading.
Reference [16] built strategies for trading multiple stocks. Reference [17] built
strategies for trading multiple cryptocurrencies. Reference [18] developed finance
portfolio optimizing strategies for stock trading.
2.2.3High Frequency Data & Forecast.
This type is using high frequency data to predict market return or direction.
References [1-4] belong to this type. Reference [1] use the information in Limit Order
Book to forecast stock prices’ short term movement. Reference [2] forecast stock price
based on order flow information. Reference [3] forecast stock price move direction
based on Limit Order Book information. Reference [4] forecast the stock price’s
quantile based on limit order book information.
2.2.4High Frequency Data & Trading Strategy.
This type is using high frequency data to discover trading strategies. References [1920] belong to this type. Reference [19] developed high frequency market making
strategy. Reference [20] did research for large tick asset’s market making strategies.

Final Remarks and Conclusions

Fig. 1. Distribution of literatures on research objects and methods

Figure 1 provides the distribution of literatures on research objects and methods. We
can see that most studied object is on non-high frequency data with trading strategy,
and most used method is RL on stocks. This review paper concludes that reinforcement
learning (RL) offers substantial improvements for financial market forecasting,
outperforming traditional models by adapting to complex, dynamic data patterns.
Including sentiment analysis further enhances RL models' predictive capabilities. The
paper serves as a research guide, suggesting future exploration in hybrid models,
sentiment integration, and risk management.
