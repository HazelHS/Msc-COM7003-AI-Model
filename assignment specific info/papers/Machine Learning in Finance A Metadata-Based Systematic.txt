Abstract: Machine learning in finance has been on the rise in the past decade. The applications of
machine learning have become a promising methodological advancement. The paper’s central goal is
to use a metadata-based systematic literature review to map the current state of neural networks and
machine learning in the finance field. After collecting a large dataset comprised of 5053 documents,
we conducted a computational systematic review of the academic finance literature intersected with
neural network methodologies, with a limited focus on the documents’ metadata. The output is a
meta-analysis of the two-decade evolution and the current state of academic inquiries into financial
concepts. Researchers will benefit from a mapping resulting from computational-based methods
such as graph theory and natural language processing.

1. Introduction
The theory and practice of finance have undergone a remarkable evolution in the past
five decades. The emergence and acceptance of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH),
its subsequent mixed empirical record, the rise of pragmatically driven ‘Chartism’, and
the present co-evolution of quantitative and behavioral finance represent some exciting
significant developments in the financial domain.
The vibrancy of finance can also be observed by two methodological revolutions
bringing sophisticated technical analysis of financial phenomena. Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) application in explaining and forecasting financial market trends has
been a significant methodological advancement in the past three decades. Another critical
research direction has been the rise of sentiment analysis of unstructured data relating to
relevant news for financial markets.
In this article, we propose to take a comprehensive look at machine learning in finance.
For that, we will use neural network as a keyword in our data collection. Using neural
network as a keyword does not limit us to just neural networks approaches, because the
source data will also contain other terms such as machine learning, deep learning, etc. The
rationale behind using neural network as a core keyword is that the most influential papers
introducing machine learning in finance used neural networks as a methodology of choice
(i.e., Gencay and Stengos 1998).
Conventional systematic literature reviews (SLR) are a process that enables the collection
of relevant evidence on a given topic that meets predefined eligibility criteria and provides
an answer to the research questions formulated. A meta-analysis necessitates descriptive
and/or inferential statistical methods to synthesize data from multiple studies on a particular
subject. The techniques facilitate the generation of knowledge from a variety of studies,
both qualitative and quantitative. The conventional method consists of four fundamental
steps: search (define the search string and database types), appraisal (pre-defined literature
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and quality assessment criteria), synthesis (extract and categorize the data), and analysis (narrate the results and finally reach a conclusion) (SALSA)

(Mengist et al. 2020). SLR is defined as a “systematic, explicit, and reproducible method
for identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the existing body of completed and recorded
work” (del Amo et al. 2018). According to Grant and Booth (2009), the SALSA framework
is a methodology for determining the search protocols that the SLR should follow. This
ensures methodological precision, standardization, comprehensiveness, and reproducibility. The majority of scientific work employed this methodological approach to mitigate
the risk of publication bias and increase the work’s acceptability (del Amo et al. 2018;
Grant and Booth 2009; Malinauskaite et al. 2019; Perevochtchikova et al. 2019). Thus, most
review articles followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses Protocol and the Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis (SALSA) framework
(Grant and Booth 2009).
From SALSA, this article adds a pre-processing step to reduce potential human biases
and highlights new results based on text-based analyses of the data collected.
Indeed, our main contribution is a computational systematic literature review of
machine learning (and neural networks in particular) in finance between 1990 and 2021.
We believe it is crucial to map the evolution of these new technologies and methodologies
in our field. When scholars in the computer science field essentially develop the Artificial
Intelligence (AI) sub-domain and machine learning techniques, including deep learning and
reinforcement learning, it is interesting to look at the bridges between these developments
and the ones in finance.
A second contribution is methodological. We indeed perform a metadata-based
systematic review of the relevant literature. In the methodology section, we will provide a
precise definition of the approach. We believe it is an essential methodological complement
to conventional qualitative reviews and econometric-based meta-analyses. A metadata
analysis means we will collect more articles than in a traditional systematic literature review
and use algorithms to filter and sort the initial dataset. The methodological approach will
be twofold: (1) we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract textas-data information, and (2) we will use graph theory to visualize potential collaboration
networks. These two methodological approaches combined will provide us a different
analysis than a formal systematic review. It is not to be seen as a substitute, but instead as
a complement to the more conventional approach.
As an aside, and although we will not spend time on this aspect, a third contribution
could be an epistemological one in nature and leverages our first contribution on the
mapping of machine learning in finance to reflect on the implications of its significance
on the old debate between theorists and chartists in finance. Markowitz (1952); Sharpe
(1963, 1964), EMH emerged as a dominant paradigm providing a formal explanation
of financial markets’ behavior. Empirical approaches emerged under the umbrella of
“Chartism” (e.g., Berardi 2011). Chartists-or empirically minded technical analysts-have
used extrapolative rules to discover statistical regularities in the time series for prices
(e.g., Hsieh 1989; Frankel and Froot 1990; Taylor and Allen 1992; Menkhoff 1997, 2010;
Lo 2004; Neely et al. 2009; Kaucic 2010; Gradojevic and Gencay 2013; Neely et al. 2014;
Gerritsen et al. 2020). Additionally, a burgeoning literature on agent-based financial market
models emerged, allowing various interactions between chartists and fundamentalists (e.g.,
Day and Huang 1990). Thanks to ML techniques, induction generates causal relationships
based on information at the moment of estimation (Popper 1962; Warin 2005). These causal
relationships are at the root of the predictive power of ML models. In the ML context,
causality and prediction seem to get theorists and technical analyses closer.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we provide a metadatabased systematic review of the academic literature on finance, published between January
1990 and May 2021. The third section elaborates the conceptual structures behind the
relevant literature by exploring the keywords, keywords co-occurrences, and the topics’
evolution based on a topic modeling technique. In the next section, we examine the
intellectual structures behind the evolution of analytical thinking on finance by focusing on
what vehicles and which organizations are the main engines in this topic dynamics. The

fifth section critically examines the social structures of our sample, encompassing different
measures to capture the social connections of authors, co-citations, and collaborations across
institutions. The concluding remarks summarize the potential of machine learning, neural
networks, and in general, the augmented technical analysis in analyzing financial markets.
2. Materials and Methods
A standard introduction to financial theory would often distinguish several valuation
models that might be useful for analyzing securities and managing portfolios (see Lee and
Lee 2010). Since the 1970s, the evolution of financial theory has been greatly influenced and
informed by the emergence and acceptance of the EMH and the Modern Portfolio Theory
(MPT) (Prasch and Warin 2016). Given the vast literature on financial analytics models, we
confine our critical review only to the main strands of the relevant academic literature.
To illustrate the development of neural networks in finance, we conduct a scientometric study of the academic literature on finance, published between January 1990 and
May 2021.
2.1. Methodology
The methodology used here is a systematic literature review with a different approach
to more conventional reviews. In usual literature reviews, the author selects the relevant
literature based on her domain or methodological expertise. Then, the analysis is based
on the content found in the sample that has been created in the initial stage. The primary
characteristics of SLR and its associated procedure, meta-analysis, are the following: (1) a
clearly stated research question that the study will address; (2) explicit and reproducible
objectives; (3) search strings that include all related studies that meet the eligibility criteria;
and (4) an assessment of the quality/validity of the selected studies.
To have a comprehensive look, conventional systematic literature might not be the
best choice. Considering the pace of the new developments in the artificial intelligence
field, we propose here to map the extent of the usage of these new technologies and
methodologies in finance. Systematic literature is a mapping exercise of a knowledge
area, and it is also really focused, with between 50 to 200 papers being analyzed. Here,
we also want to map the machine learning knowledge area while collecting a significant
number of documents. The large dataset size will allow us to build an analysis based on the
documents’ metadata, such as authors’ affiliations, universities, etc. This research protocol
built around a metadata-based systematic literature review could be considered the first
phase in a systematic literature review.
In contrast to more conventional methods, we have two phases: First, similar to a
traditional systematic review, the selection of the relevant articles is performed via a search
engine, except the expert does not select the relevant articles from the results presented to
her. Here, the expert chooses the keywords and creates a comprehensive dataset of all the
documents matching the keywords in the title, abstract, keyword, and keyword + section.
The first phase, being automated, allows the utilization of quantitative criteria to filter
down the dataset. Then, in the second phase, a dataset reduction to 50–200 documents is
made by an expert.
To summarize, one of the critical contributions of a metadata-based systematic literature review is to reduce—though not wholly—potential human biases. Another significant
contribution of this new methodology based on these two phases is that it allows us to
consider the documents’ metadata in a text format. By adding a computational treatment
based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform the text into data,
we can then provide analyses that would not be possible otherwise, leveraging analytical
approaches such as graph theory. It is particularly relevant to discover research patterns,
research history, the actual research vehicles, or to be able to associate discoveries with
institutions, to name a few examples. These sophisticated techniques allow us to perform a
literature mapping thanks to this computational approach.


J. Risk Financial Manag. 2021, 14, 302

Another critical point is the large size of the dataset, which has a lot of favorable
statistical properties. We will also use algorithms to help us analyze quantities of papers
that we would not be able to do otherwise due to the sheer quantity of information analyzed
by a human.
Finally, another important dimension is using each document’s reference section to
perform metrics that allow researchers to understand the knowledge transmission patterns.
Beyond the computational treatment and to leverage the results obtained from these
computations, we use the following theoretical framework. Aria et al. (2017) propose to
look at three different structures: the conceptual, intellectual, and social structures. The
conceptual structures are about leveraging the metadata to help us understand which
concepts and topics are used in the academic conversation and how they have evolved
through time. The intellectual structure will help us understand who produced these
concepts, which journals played a pivot role in this nascent literature, and which articles
were among the most referenced that fueled this literature. Lastly, the social structure will
allow us to look at authors’ collaborations and the knowledge support from universities
and countries through their collaborations.
The data collection will be conducted using a “human-in-the-loop” (HIL) approach. It
consists of proceeding to a purely automated data collection with an ex-post validation
based on the field expertise.
First, we use an automated process in two phases as described earlier. The search
was performed on the publisher-independent citation database “Web of Science” (WoS),
Clarivate Analytics, by using combinations of keywords (and simultaneously removing the
duplicates): “neural network*” AND “finance*”.
These keywords allow us to build our sample. This sample does not aim at being
representative of the domain. Instead, it intends to analyze the dynamics of the conversation about neural networks in finance. By building a sample about a modeling technique,
we risk overfitting the true representativity of neural networks in finance if someone is
interested in generalizing; this is not our intent.
We then use human-based field expertise to review the references anyway while
adding some potential missing references based on the domain expertise (see Appendix A
for a list of the added references). HIL allows us to have a combined qualitative assessment
with pure automatic data collection. This second step is marginal in terms of added articles,
but it is crucial for quality control.
Our approach differs at these two levels: in the sample creation, we try to be as
comprehensive as possible on a particular topic, here “neural network*” AND “financ*”.
The stars mean that we collect any occurrence with a declination of the word’s root. We
use neural networks as a proxy for machine learning techniques as authors who use
neural networks also reference machine learning in their keywords (among 10,160 used
keywords and 3606 keywords Plus, see Table 1). So, the sample includes papers on
machine learning as well. The sample is likely not comprehensive, as in any systematic
literature review, but it is larger than conventional methods. The sample is collected by
finding matches in the text title, the abstract, the keywords, and the keywords + in Web
of Science. It helps us create a 5053 rich sample, a larger sample than regular, systematic
reviews. We can deal with a larger sample thanks to the second differentiation point of
our methodology: leveraging the sample metadata through computational techniques.
The dataset can be found on the following webpage, including a search engine: https:
//warin.ca/posts/article-machine-learning-finance/ (accessed date: 29 June 2021).
In this second level of differentiation, we create and use the metadata from the title,
the abstract, the keywords, and the keywords +. The creation of metadata is conducted
via Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We prepare the dataset by selecting
tokens, n-grams, etc. (Aria and Cuccurullo 2017).
These metadata are helpful to provide quantitative analysis to the sample. Using these
machine learning tools allows us to have a research synthesis that can be leveraged with

other techniques such as social network analysis. We can also look at the dynamics of the
research contributions, the collaborations, the idea generation, and propagation.

The overall number of documents in our sample is 5053 (see Table 1). This number
is the cumulative result of each year, and we can observe a significant rise in the number
of documents per year. The average citations per document are 14.66 but have evolved
through time to numbers ranging between 1 and 2. As a reference point, the total citations
per paper in economics and business for the highly cited papers were 3.04 for the 2011–2015
period and 3.91 for the 2017–2021 period. In Social Sciences in general, the total citations
per paper for the highly cited papers were 2.89 for the 2011–2015 period and 3.30 for the
2017–2021 period. These results show the normalization of machine learning in financerelated documents.
The number of articles dominates the sample for the overall period (see Table 2) with
2719 occurrences, followed by 1974 proceedings papers. So, short contributions (articles
and proceedings papers) represent the actual output in this sample. Authors indeed
tend to produce the knowledge body about machine learning in finance through short
contributions (e.g., Gu et al. 2020).

To conclude this descriptive statistics section, we observed a similar trend in the
academic production about machine learning in finance based on short documents and
co-authorship. Let us now analyze the three different structures: conceptual, intellectual,
and social.

3. Conceptual Structures of Our Sample
The application of AI in the domain of finance is not a recent phenomenon in the
academic literature (e.g., Hutchinson et al. 1994; Lo et al. 2000; Gavrishchaka and Banerjee
2006; De Spiegeleer et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2020). However, the last decade witnessed
empirical studies using Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) to examine credit risk
analysis and forecasting stock returns. As Dixon et al. (2020, p. vii) highlight, “ML in
finance sits at the intersection of several emergent disciplines, including pattern recognition,
financial econometrics, statistical computing, probabilistic programming, and dynamic
programming”. One of the main competitive advantages of ML is that computers have an
outstanding ability to process large amounts of financial information.
From a methodological perspective, the empirical studies rely not only on conventional
MLAs such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) but also on
Deep Learning (DL) (e.g., Krauss et al. 2017; Fischer and Krauss 2018; Huang et al. 2020), an
advanced technique based on artificial neural network algorithms (e.g., Chung-Ming and
White 1994; Donaldson and Kamstra 1997; Hans and Griensven 1998; Gencay and Stengos
1998; Blake and Kapetanios 2000; Garcia and Gencay 2000; Fernandez-Rodrıguez et al.
2000; Bekiros and Georgoutsos 2008; Kristjanpoller and Minutolo 2018; Atsalakis et al. 2019).
Some DL models were also used to predict stock prices (e.g., Kraus and Feuerriegel 2017;
Minh et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2018; Matsubara et al. 2018). For instance, Schumaker and
Chen (2010) make a stock market forecasting based on financial news articles using a text
classification approach. Glasserman et al. (2020) study using the supervised Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (sLDA) framework to select news articles topics to explain stock returns.
The network analysis has been used more in the context of financial stability analysis
and financial linkages. Another strand of the literature examines the impact of views and
opinions of investors-also known as investor sentiment-on stock price movements. The
sentiment analysis aims to capture news by traditional and/or social media and assess the
investors’ views and market mood (e.g., Mitra and Mitra 2011; Mitra and Yu 2016). The
assessment of market sentiment-often captured by market indices-can be strengthened by
sentiment analysis of the market mood or investors’ emotions. A popular approach is to
extract relevant news articles, preprocess the text, and assign a sentiment score to each
article. The sentiment score is then commonly calculated as the difference between the
number of positive and negative words in the article divided by the total number of words.
The studies use a reputable lexicon of financial terms-such as Loughran and McDonald
(2011) lexicon-to determine positive and negative words.
In the following sub-sections, we will consider the conceptual structures of our sample
by looking at the keywords, the keywords co-occurrences, and the evolution of the topics
based on a topic modeling technique.
3.1. Keywords Analyses
We consider here the entire words that we find in the keyword section of every document. Remember that the sample was created using “neural network*” AND “finance*”
(see Figure 2). It is thus expected that authors would again put neural networks as keywords in the keyword section. They will also associate other keywords such as prediction,
forecasting, or machine learning, including deep learning. This is evidence that our sample
goes beyond just neural networks but also covers other related topics.
It is interesting to see that deep learning is a very recent addition to the fintech field,
as approximated by our sample. It is also interesting to notice that it is recently that the
reasons why we would use the new techniques in finance have appeared, for instance, the
role of these new methodologies in prediction. Machine learning techniques are indeed a
paradigm shift when it comes to their predictive power.

keywords. From there, we can compute some relevant network indicators (centrality,
density, etc.). Several figures will plot the relevance degree (centrality, or notions of
‘importance’) against the development degree (density). Degree centrality counts the
number of links held by each node and points at themes that can easily connect with the
broader network. The density of a network is the frequency of realized edges relative to
potential edges.
In Figure 3, we represent the graphs based on the network indicators. The first figure
is the network of keywords for the entire sample, while each other graph represents a
network for 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
When we consider the co-occurrences networks, particularly the years 2021 and 2017,
we observe that most of the conversations are organized around two groups, representing
both computer techniques and mathematical approaches. Only recently, applications in
finance are starting to appear, such as the prediction of bankruptcies.
In Table 6, we compute the mathematical features of the networks. We observe that
the size of the networks has been on the rise in the past years, showing an increase in the
spread of the concepts. It is accompanied by a decrease in density through time with a

3.3. Topic Modeling-Based Analyses
In the following analysis, we will add a new dimension based on structural topic
modeling. The goal here is to complement the information we obtained from the keywords co-occurrences. A structural topic modeling first means that we will leverage
words including the keywords section and beyond: the title section, the abstract, and the
keyword + section.
We tokenize all the words, and we compute the latent variables to identify potential topics.
In the following figures, we represent this analysis. The top-left figure covers the
whole period, while the other figures represent each year, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, and
2017, respectively.

In 2017, a generic algorithm was an emerging theme as well as network theory. We see
here a burgeoning reflection about what will become the contribution from data science in
finance. Comparing 2017 and 2020, and 2021, it is interesting to see that the motor themes
are about the predictive capacity of machine learning-based models. We can also observe
the emerging sub-field of deep learning in finance. We can easily extrapolate and imagine
that deep learning in finance will have a prominent future in the field.

We can go a little further and look now at the articles that authors in our sample
include in their references. As such, those references are the foundations of this nascent
literature in machine learning in finance. Let us look at the top authors in the references of
each paper (see Figure 8).
We can also look at the most cited references in terms of journals beyond their authors.

reference was included in the co-citation network of references (see Figure 11). Therefore,

In our sample, most of the authors in finance are residents of the People’s Republic of
China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India (see Table 8). While the dominant
presence of authors from the advanced economies is undisputed, it is also noticeable that
the law of large numbers ensures the participation of authors from several Emerging
Market Economies (EMEs).

Table 9 provides Supplementary Materials on the total citations per country. Asia and
China, in particular, dominate the ranking.
Figure 12 shows an apparent increase in the contributions coming from Asia: China
and India being at the forefront of academic production.
Starting from a bibliographic matrix, two groups of descriptive measures are computed: (1) the summary statistics of the network and (2) the leading indices of centrality
and prestige of vertices.
This group of statistics presented in Table 8 allows us to describe the structural properties of a network: (1) ‘size’: is the number of vertices composing the network; (2) ‘density’:
is the proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network; (3) ‘transitivity’
is the ratio of triangles to connected triples; (4) ‘diameter’ is the longest geodesic distance
(length of the shortest path between two nodes) in the network; (5) ‘degree distribution’
is the cumulative distribution of vertex degrees, and (6) ‘degree centralization’ is the
normalized degree of the overall network.
When it comes to countries’ collaborations, China and the USA are at the center of
the graph (see Figure 13). Most of the international collaborations are between China and
the USA. There seems to be a slight regionalization of collaborations, China with Asian
countries, though it is much less apparent in the case of the USA, which seems to be a bit
more eclectic in terms of collaborations.

5.3. Co-Citations of Journals
We will look at which journals have contributed to developing the field’s methodological transformation in what follows. Through time (see Table 10), we will see that it mostly
started in more engineering journals to penetrate the finance field. Still, nowadays, the
ranking is dominated by more engineering-oriented journals.

Figure 14 is an excellent illustration of the evolution of the knowledge map seen
through journal co-citations. It is interesting to see the origin of the transformation and the
pace of the penetration of machine learning in finance journals and through which channels.
It is worth noticing the pivotal role played by the “Expert Systems with Applications” journal.

laboration networks both at the authors’ level and the institutional level for policymakers.
It is also relevant to be able to visualize the knowledge maps.
For further research, the appearance of artificial intelligence and machine learning,
in particular in finance, is quite attractive in the context of the old-time debate between
the theorists and the chartists. While the opposing theorists and chartists debate is still
relevant, we conjecture that ML techniques could shed some new light on theoretical
advancement. MLAs are not an atheoretical approach, as it is premised on inductive
reasoning, which generates causal relationships based on the state of information at the
moment of estimation. The main advantage of ML is the ability to process vast information,
simultaneously ignoring ideological standpoints or inclinations to a particular school
of thought.
